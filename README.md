## File Locations
1. Raw FastQ and FastQC files:    
/datastorage/2016_Isilon/Kong/MethylSeq/Kong_pool2_20160721    
    
2. BAM and COV files processed by John Gaspar:    
/datastorage/2016_Isilon/john/MethylSeq2/UA    
    
3. RNA FastQ:    
/datastorage1/2016_Isilon/Kong/RNASeq/RNAseq_UA    
    
4. RNA BAM and DIFF files processed by John Gaspar:    
/datastorage1/2016_Isilon/john/RNAseq/UA    
    
There are 8 samples. Legend is in Anne's PowerPoint (see *Lable_Acute UV exposure in BL6_Methyl-seq_RNA.pptx* in docs)

## ToDo
# 03/29/2018
1. Dedup DNA BAM files    
2. Compare:   
  a. UVB 1 day vs UVB 1 week    
  b. Ctrl, UVB and UVB+UA at 1 week (model + paerwise post hoc)   
3. Same for RNA   
4. Compare DNA and RNA signatures    
NOTE: low quality RNA, do FastQC (only done for 1 sample, 13% unique reads)
